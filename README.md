# Push_Swap_42_Project_05

The Push_swap project is a sorting algorithm project at school 42 that involves creating a program
to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement an efficient
algorithm that can sort the stack with the minimum number of moves.

The main objective of the project is to develop two programs: a checker program that verifies if a
given list of instructions correctly sorts the stack, and a push_swap program that generates a list of instructions to sort the stack.

Students are required to implement various sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, selection sort,
or merge sort, and optimize them to minimize the number of operations performed. They need to carefully manage the stack operations,
including swapping elements, pushing elements between stacks, and rotating elements within the stack.

The push_swap program must output a list of instructions that, when executed, sorts the stack.
The checker program reads the instructions and validates if the stack is correctly sorted.

The project also emphasizes code efficiency, clarity, and error handling. Students are encouraged to
analyze and optimize their algorithms to achieve the best possible performance.

In summary, the Push_swap project at school 42 involves developing sorting algorithms to sort a stack of
integers using a limited set of operations. It challenges students to optimize their algorithms and devise
efficient strategies to minimize the number of moves required for sorting. This project enhances their
problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic complexity.
